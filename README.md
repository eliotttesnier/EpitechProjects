# 🗂️ EpitechProjects

This repository is a dump of all my projects developed during my years at **EPITECH Nantes** (2023–2028).  
It includes both solo and group work, across various technologies and subjects.

## 🧠 Goals

- Track personal progress
- Share coding experience with others
- Keep a central archive of work done at Epitech

---

> ⚠️ Some projects may not represent production-level code — many were done under learning constraints and strict deadlines.
